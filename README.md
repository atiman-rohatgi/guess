#project guess_game

objective: this is just a simple guessing game, but this time around I have used scheme as the language to build this.

functionality 

              -the program generates a random number which it does not show to the user.
              
              -then it asks the user to guess that number and tells whether to guess higher or lower.


  language: scheme
